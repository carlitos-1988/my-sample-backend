## Overview

This application will generate shifts in a random order and ensure people work all shifts available. It will also ensure that shift constrainst are being adhered to for example minimum staff and seniority requirements for patient care.

## Why We Built This Application

Many healthcare institutions still rely on paper-based scheduling systems, which can result in a variety of issues. Management may exhibit favoritism by giving preferred employees more favorable shifts, leading to inequities in scheduling. Additionally, due to the lack of visibility, employees may be unaware of changes to the schedule, leading to confusion and potential scheduling conflicts. It is imperative that hospitals and other healthcare organizations transition to modern, digital scheduling systems to improve efficiency and ensure fair and transparent scheduling practices.
